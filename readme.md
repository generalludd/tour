#Tour: A small tour management system

Built for a baseball tours operator, https://ballparktours.net, this system offers the following features:
* An address book with ability to associate multiple people with a single address
* A tour list that allows adding individuals from the address book to tours as payers or "tourists" (people who are guests of a payer)
* A hotel module that includes options to add hotel contacts and other information and the ability to associate a hotel with multiple tours
* A roomate scheduler that allows adding roommates to hotels for different days of the tour, the kind of room requested and the ability to print out a sheet for use at the Hotel
* A simple letter merge option that allows creation of boilerplate letters to be printed and the ability to add notes and a small remittance note at the bottom
* Payment tracking including complementary tickets, partial payment tracking, and other documentation (not connected to any 3rd party payment service).
