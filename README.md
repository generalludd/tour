A database for managing small tours. 

Built on the Code Igniter framework, this simple tour management system is being designed for a client who runs one to two annual tours to various baseball parks across the country. Each tour is usually three to five days and averages about 25 tourists. The system includes an address book, ability to add information about tours including prices, discounts and room rates (such as increases for single rooms and discounts for triple and quad room arrangements), recording ticket purchases and guests for each ticket purchased. Hotels and roommates for each hotel stay. The system does not include information about ballparks, so this could be used for any kind of tour. 

The system is capable of exporting CSV records from the address book based on several criteria the client requested, and also to export CSV records of payer/tourist records for a given tour. 

Configuration requires familiarity with Code Igniter, MySQL and PHP. In future releases better installation instructions will be included. 

A nearly-blank database named tour.sql (with only some core values for global function) is included in the root of the project.
